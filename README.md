# KeyTranslator---Konsolenanwendung

A small console application I coded with C#. The program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages.

1) Enter message
2) Enter key (Vigenere code ) [changes a 'k' with key '3' to an 'n']
3) Read encrypted message

No object oriented programming. Read my code and try it out.
